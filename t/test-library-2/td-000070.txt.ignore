title:: INVALID NON-UNIQUE ID

===

This test data file illustrates a non-unique ID problem.  An SML
document should not contain multiple entities with the same ID.  The
software should warn the user when it discovers a non-unique ID.

title:: This is problem 1

type:: technical

description:: There is no problem with problem 1.

>>>problem.problem-70-1

title:: This is problem 2

type:: technical

description:: The problem with problem 2 is that it has the same ID as
problem 1.  That's a problem!  The application should warn the user it
found a non-unique ID in the document.
