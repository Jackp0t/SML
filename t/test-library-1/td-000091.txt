!!Comment Lines and Blocks.!! ([ref:comments]) SML gives you two
ways to insert comment lines.  First, any line beginning with ||#|| in
the first column is considered a comment, making it easy to `comment
out' individual lines of text. Second, any division of text that
begins with >>>COMMENT and ends with <<<COMMENT is considered a
comment, making it easy to `comment out' whole regions of text.
